Fundamental machine learning datasets and models. You can choose a dataset and train it using this interface.
I made this interface to give a hint about machine learning to a curious friend. 
# Datasets
- Iris
- MNIST
- Wine
# Models
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Tree
- Random Forests
# Contribution
This project has a long way to go so, any contributions are welcome.
## Suggestions

- Creating a Python dictionary or json file for Datasets and Models and ensuring that the definitions corresponding to the model and dataset are called with functions while the page is loaded.
- Adding more comprehensive definitions and descriptions for models and datasets.
- Adding new models and datasets.
